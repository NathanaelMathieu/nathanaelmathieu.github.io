  `When I approached Prof. Moller about making my portfolio for the upcoming spring deadlines I had mixed feelings about his suggestion that I make a web-based portfolio. I knew that it was going to be a lot of work, but that wasn't the issue. My biggest hesitation was with the what work would actually be. I had been working on Front End theory and then design for much of 2019, and came out of the theory portion excited and considering a career as a Front End developer. Then I started to work at a company doing, mostly, front end. It was not very enjoyable. I found myself far less excited about it than any other coding project I had done before.

  `So, after the meeting with Moller, I decided I would give it a go, hoping that it would solidify my feelings about it.  My conclusion was that I loved design and hated front end. Envisioning something and making it a reality is exciting. CSS and HTML drive me insane. This was an unfortunate thing to realize as I committed to this major project, but gave me plenty of clarity.
  I started this whole project by deciding on my language and tools; I had worked with React.JS and SCSS the previous summer, so I went with them. I decided to build all my components from scratch to show my front end skills off, a decision that caused many headaches later on. After sketching some Project Page designs, I decided on the 3 column grid that this page uses, and decided to build myself a component to hold each image.

` This component, ImageCard, soaked up many hours. I have little patience for CSS problems, and it bugged me to repeatedly have to solve the same problems over and over again. I am pretty proud of ImageCard, though, as it evolved from a container for static-ratio images to a dynamic card with clickability and hover text. Overall, it's highly customizable, and I'm pretty proud of that. When I encountered a feature I wanted it to have, I put it into my backlog and tried to add it soon. Still, everything would have been much easier if I had used a component library for this and all the other elements.

  I did plenty of layout wireframes, eventually making a bunch of moveable pieces of paper that I could rearrange freely. This was a great tool, and led to much faster prototyping of designs. The Contact page was initially designed as a minimalist About Me page, but I realized it worked excellently in that context and built it for that. My hope is that future IDEAS students will consider using {<a href="https://github.com/NathanaelMathieu/IDEAS-Portfolio-Template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a>}. I&apos;ve put a lot of time into it, and it won&apos;t be the resume-building project I once hoped it would be. Hopefully future minor applicants will appreciate it and build on it.
