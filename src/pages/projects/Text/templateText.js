  This project was meant to serve as a template for future IDEAS minors at Wesleyan. It was my first self-guided foray into JavaScript and React. Color scheme aside, I ended up with some fairly robust components which are in use on this website. My most serious work was done during the Winter of 2020, and I ran three two week Agile sprints to get the project to the point where I could submit it. My initial wire frames went through brief user tests with a few friends before being adjusted and built. I tried my best to build the HiFi design that I had tested in LoFi, adhering to industry practices.

  While I enjoyed the rhythm of the sprints, this project was mostly frustrating to me. My frustrations working with CSS were considerable, and I grew further disillusioned with being a Front End Developer. Javascript, and in particular the recent updates to React involving memoization, were the most compelling part of this project for me. Unfortunately, those features were overkill for anything within the project's scope.

  This component, ImageCard, soaked up many hours. I have little patience for CSS problems, and it bugged me to repeatedly have to solve the same problems over and over again. I am pretty proud of ImageCard, though, as it evolved from a container for static-ratio images to a dynamic card with clickability and hover text.
  Overall, it's highly customizable, and I'm proud of that. When I encountered a feature I wanted it to have, I put it into my backlog and added it to the next sprint. Many of those improvements were more robust replacement components, many of which were used in this website.

    I did plenty of layout wire frames, eventually making a bunch of moveable pieces of paper that I could rearrange freely. This was a great tool, and led to much faster prototyping of designs. The Contact page was initially designed as a minimalist About Me page, but I realized it worked excellently in that context and built it for that. My hope is that future IDEAS students will consider using {<a href="https://github.com/NathanaelMathieu/IDEAS-Portfolio-Template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a>}. Hopefully future IDEAS Minor applicants will appreciate it and build on it.
