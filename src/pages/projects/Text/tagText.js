  `This was my first IDEAS Project, and it was a fairly ambitious one. In the first iteration of IDEAS 175, my group of four decided to build a customizable robot battling platform that would allow people to develop their own mechanisms for competing in a game generally known as Tag. The game was based around collecting little cubes and hoarding them in base zones designated for each of the two teams. As a group, we designed the playing field, robot cage covered in mount points, and a few example mechanisms.

  `My component of the project was to design and manufacture the cages. This was a tricky task, as the robots were already constructed as part of the class. I had to work around those design specifications while also defining and supporting my own set of specifications for attaching to the cage. The mount point design I settled on featured a plus-shape with a center hole cut out. Wires could be passed through any of the larger holes in the cage if the component needed to be powered, and the functionality of the robot's movement was unimpeded by the cage.

  `As far as first projects go, this one was pretty well done. I went through multiple iterations of drafts in fairly quick succession, utilizing SolidWorks Assemblies to rapidly prototype the different parts an how they interfaced together. The most challenging aspects of the project were due to relying too heavily on these assemblies.
  SolidWorks was still quite new to me at this time. While I felt confident in using it to create these 2D parts and 3D assemblies, I doubted my ability to make more complex things. I would often find that my design worked virtually, but that it did not fit well on the robot. The solution, which I was aware of, would be to create a virtual robot to test against. Brief attempts to do so were not successful, so this more wasteful but still effective process of physical prototyping was used instead. That process would only grow more refined throughout the rest of my IDEAS career.
