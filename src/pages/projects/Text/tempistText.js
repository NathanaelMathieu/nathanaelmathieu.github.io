  Tempist was a group project for COMP345 - Human Computer Interaction at the University of Auckland. I was in a group of five, working together to build and test a series of prototypes for a group work management software suite. Our design process followed industry standard procedures, starting with stakeholder mapping, developing personas, and considering the features that would be helpful to users.

  One of my primary contributions involved designing the Gantt View, which graphically represents the timeline of tasks. The blue task bars could be clicked to show more details and dragged to change the length and dates. My LoFi wireframe designs were build by a teammate in JS and CSS using Bootstrap. We ran a brief series of user tests on this HiFi Prototype, practicing good scientific testing techniques.
