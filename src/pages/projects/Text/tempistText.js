  `Tempist was a group project for COMP345 - Human Computer Interaction at the University of Auckland. I was in a group of five, working together to build and test a series of prototypes for a group work management software suite. Our design process followed industry standard procedures, starting with stakeholder mapping, developing personas, and considering the features that would be helpful to users.

  `The group functioned very well together; potentially the best out of all the groups I have worked with in college. This was definitely due in part to the assignments themselves being fairly light for this number of people, but we all split into the roles that felt most comfortable and made our deadlines without much difficulty. Since getting five people together in the same room can be quite difficult, we made sure to cover everything that needed to be done in person whenever we got together. The impressive cohesion of the group made the project, building tools to help manage group work, quite ironic.
