`In what amounted to my most challenging group project by far, my group of three set out to build a marble run. A kids toy, I thought, shouldn't be that hard to make. Prof. Voth initially suggested that it might be more challenging than we expected, and boy was he right.
Problems abounded early on. We had plenty of trouble getting all of our team together for meetings, and my contributions were hampered by a concussion that lingered for several weeks. Beyond that, a series of prototyping failures and poor intra-group communication led to a much worse final product than hoped. These are reasons enough to leave this project on the portfolio, but the skills I gained are too significant to pass over.

`My greatest accomplishment to date in SolidWorks is the manufacture of a funnel for 3D printing. Not only was it a fairly complex part by the standards demanded of IDEAS 170, I was also committed to not waste time or filament by only doing one print. Rather than assuming that this 20+ hour print would work as a component of the marble run, I decided to learn how to use SolidWorks Motion, an add in that allows for the simulation of many part interactions. This allowed me to test the effectiveness of a marble rolling around the funnel. It took plenty of research, but the result makes me very proud to this day.

`The biggest problem we encountered in construction of our marble run's track was designing clips that would hold the track together. We made the decision to use rigid wire as a connector between different elements, something that we came to regret. The wire was hard to work with, heavy, and broke any clips we made out of Medium Density Fiberboard. 3D printed clips had to be used instead, but they took orders of magnitude longer to manufacture. The prototypes here demonstrate how one design decision, using a stiff wire instead of tubing, can make a related design challenge nearly impossible.
