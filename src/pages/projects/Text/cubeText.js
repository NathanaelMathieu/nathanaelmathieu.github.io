    The Cube was a combination of elements from a poster by Yusaka Kamekura for the Tokyo International Lighting Design Competition of 1979. Steps were taken to transform the poster into a 3D paper object. The outside and inside feature the same grid that made up the foreground of the poster, and the hexagonal entrances, or portals, are a based on the lighting fixtures. After mapping the object into a third dimension, the portals allow the viewer to look into the interior space of the cube as well as out to the other side.

    The main theme of this work is perspective. In reference to the original poster, the interior space of the cube is lit by ambient light from the room the viewer is in. By viewing the space through a portal, that portal becomes covered, affecting what the viewer sees. When the viewer looks through the space back into the room, there is a telescoping effect that focuses their attention on the small field of view. This change in perspective can be surprising. The colors that rim the portals change the way we see the world on the other side.

    This project's prompt involved taking a poster and turning it into some sort of paper-based work. I was fixed on the portals being three dimensional but not stacked paper, and in order to achieve that I had to be clever about how I folded and glued the portals together. I was unable to find a cohesive way of holding them together, so I pivoted to hexagons. The flat sides were much easier to work with, as folding along the crease made a perfect area to glue to adjacent sections.

    The change from circular to hexagonal portals was the only prototyping step done physically. In order to test my Adobe Illustrator abilities and save paper and ink, I focused on prototyping entirely digitally. This was as challenging as you would imagine, but after printing and cutting two sides of the cube with circular portals I realized that a different shape would have to be used. Hexagons were chosen for their visual fit on the triangular grid. After printing and laser cutting the components out, assembly took several hours.

     Many of the roadblocks I encountered in this project were dealt with in the conceptual digital phase, including working out the sizing of the tabs that connect each section of the portals together and ensuring that they would connect in a seamless way. Since the portals would be visible both from the outside and from the inside through other portals, both sides of portal needed to appear free of adhesives or other attaching methods. This led to very carefully sized tabs that did not overlap so that all necessary adhesive would be directly between each piece of paper.

    My biggest takeaway from this project was the vast amount of resources that can be saved by adequately planning the entirety of the project before beginning. I have previously been more of a "dive in and try it" prototyper, spending less time initially on the conceptual work. While I am successful in that approach, I feel better able to use a more balanced, methodical process in the future.
