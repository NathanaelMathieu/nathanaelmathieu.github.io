  `Hi, my name is Nate. I am a Computer Science Major in the Class of 2020 at Wesleyan University, and I use he/him pronouns.

  Since high school I've been answering the question, "What do you want to do?" with "Build Stuff." It's not a very specific goal by any means, but it speaks to my underlying desire to create. That desire has shaped much of my life. Whether it is working on coding, cooking, baking, brewing, or building, I have devoted endless hours to craft.

  I started out at Wesleyan in 2016. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to study and what my career should look like. Initially a prospective Physics major, I quickly realized that my talents and interests did not fully align with that path. Purely by chance, my pre-major advisor could not see me for a meeting during Add/Drop of my Sophomore Fall and I met with Prof. Francis Starr, now the IDEAS Director, and learned about the program. It felt like an excellent step towards uniting my Wesleyan education with my desire to create. I dove in headfirst.`

      The past two years have been eventful; I became an IDEAS Lab Assistant before the new lab was built, and finished up both IDEAS 170 and 175. I took advantage of Wesleyan&apos;s Study Abroad programs, traveling to the University of Auckland in New Zealand where I studied Human-Centered Design among other things. Upon returning to Wesleyan I took both Digital Art and Artificial Intelligence, completing the requirements of the IDEAS Computer track.

      This website is based on a portfolio template which I have spent several months preparing for future IDEAS students. Built using React.JS, I decided to build almost everything from scratch as a demonstration of my Javascript abilities. The template&apos;s source code can be seen and contributed to {<a href="https://github.com/NathanaelMathieu/IDEAS-Portfolio-Template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>} and the source code for my portfolio can be seen {<a href="https://github.com/NathanaelMathieu/IDEAS-Portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>}.
