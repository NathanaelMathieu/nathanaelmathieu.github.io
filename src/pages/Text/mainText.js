        Since high school I`&apos`ve been answering the question, `&quo`What do you want to do`&quo` with `&quo`Build Stuff.`&quo` It`&apos`s not a very specific goal by any means, but it speaks to my underlying desire to create. That desire has shaped much of my life. Whether it is working on coding, cooking, baking, brewing, or building, I have devoted endless hours to craft.
