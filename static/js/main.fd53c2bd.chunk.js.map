Designed as an installation piece, Basinski analyzes our relationship with memory, time, and emotion. A simple time lapse of a sunset plays on a screen with a webcam as the song dlp 1.1 plays in the background. dlp 1.1 comes from William Basinski' The Disintegration Loops, a series of short magnetic tape loops played as the magnetic material that represents their sound falls off. As the viewer observes the sunset and the hour long song plays, they begin to notice that their movements change the image.\n`\n}\n/>;\n\nexport const t2 = <Text text=\n{\n`As the song loops, the sunset begins to show them watching it. The webcam video continues to blend into the sunset until they are deeply connected. The tape continues to degrade. The sunset loses its color as the webcam becomes more apparent in the bright areas of the video. Near the end of the hour, almost none of the sunset remains. The sun is there, but the rest is just a tint on the screen. The song fades to darkness, and the video fades to black.\nThis piece was ambitious for numerous reasons. I committed to it during a very difficult time in my life. Both of my remaining grandparents entered hospice and passed away within a week of each other, provoking a lot of painful thoughts and emotions. I decided to channel that into the piece, writing a program that would meld the now into the past.\n`}\n/>;\n\nexport const t3 = <Text text=\n{\n`The Disintegration Loops have always reminded me of how fleeting our time is, and how our memory is even more fleeting. The sunset is meant to represent a beautiful memory that is fading with every passing day. As we remember it, or observe the video, we affect it, inserting ourselves into that place. We experience it for what it is now; a memory, and not for what it was. These changes stack until the memory is all but gone.\nI wasn't sure how I would implement this program, but committed to using Processing and interacted with the libraries directly using Java. My most critical accomplishments in terms of code were two functions that considered whether the video was being observed.\n`}\n/>;\n\nexport const t4 = <Text text=\n{\n`\nChanges in the RGB levels of the room and noise threshold on the mic would trigger the function that, with some randomness, faded in the webcam footage. This slow fade produced a noticeable effect if you watched for five or more minutes, but not if you watched a few loops of the sunset and then walked away.\nWhile this project is probably the one I am most proud of, I have been thus far unable to make a portable copy that can be viewed by others. The code is, similarly, not accessible at present. I hope to have both public in the near future.`\n}\n/>;\n","import \"./Basinski.scss\";\nimport { ImageCard, Layout } from \"../../components\";\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport { b1, b2, b3, b4 } from \"../../resources/projects/basinski\";\n\nimport { t1, t2, t3, t4 } from \"./Text/basinskiText.js\";\n\nexport default class Basinski extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    document.title = \"Basinski | Nathanael Mathieu\";\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Layout>\n        <div className=\"Basinski\">\n          <div className=\"image_text\">\n            <ImageCard alt=\"A yellow and red sunset in front of some bushes\"\n              size=\"4x6\" image={b1}\n              textEnabled text=\"Only the sunset can be seen\"/>\n            {t1}\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"image_text\">\n            <ImageCard alt=\"The sunset again, but a person's outline is just visible\"\n              size=\"4x6\"image={b2}\n              textEnabled text=\"My silhouette is barely visible\"/>\n            {t2}\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"image_text\">\n            <ImageCard alt=\"The sunset but my silhouette is plainly in frame\"\n              size=\"4x6\"image={b3}\n              textEnabled text=\"The webcam is plainly visible now\"/>\n            {t3}\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"image_text\">\n            <ImageCard alt=\"The entire image is black except for the burnt red sun that illuminates my face\"\n              size=\"4x6\"image={b4}\n              textEnabled text=\"A frame near the end of the piece.

Several steps were taken to transform the poster into a 3D object. The outside and inside feature the same grid that made up the foreground of the poster, and the hexagonal entrances, or portals, are a based on the lighting fixtures installed in the poster's grid. After mapping the object into a third dimension, the portals allow the viewer to look into the interior space of the cube as well as out to the other side.\n`\n}\n/>;\n\nexport const t2 = <Text text=\n{\n`The main theme of this work is perspective. Meant as a reference to the cube’s origins as a Lighting Design competition, the interior space of the cube is lit by ambient light from the room the viewer is in. By viewing the space through a portal, the lighting of the space necessarily changes, affecting what the viewer sees. When the viewer looks through the space back into the room, there is a telescoping effect that focuses their attention on the small area in view. This change in perspective can be surprising as the colors that rim the portals change the way we see that limited field of view.\n`}\n/>;\n\nexport const t3 = <Text text=\n{\n`This project involved taking a poster and turning it into some sort of paper-based work. The poster I had chosen featured a grid with concentric circles of different colors rimmed with a glowing light effect. The initial plan was to make a cube with these circular \"portals\", as I came to call them, but upon construction of the first prototype it was clear that circles would not work.\nI was fixed on the portals being 3D but not stacked paper, and in order to achieve that I had to be clever about how I folded and glued the portals together. I was unable to find a cohesive way of holding them together, so I pivoted to hexagons. The flat sides were much easier to work with, as folding along the crease made a perfect area to glue to adjacent sections.\n`}\n/>;\n\nexport const t4 = <Text text=\n{\n`The change from circular to hexagonal portals was the only prototyping step done physically. In order to test my Adobe Illustrator abilities and save paper and ink, I focused on prototyping entirely digitally. This was as challenging as you would imagine, but after printing and cutting two sides of the cube with circular portals I realized that a different shape would have to be used. Hexagons were chosen for their visual fit on the triangular grid. After printing and laser cutting the components out, assembly took several hours.`\n}\n/>;\n\nexport const t5 = <Text text=\n{\n`While the greatest obstacle that I overcame in this project was the redesign of the portals, there were multiple other components that I had to work through. Many of these were in done in the conceptual digital phase, including working out the sizing of the tabs that connect each section of the portals together and ensuring that they would connect in a seamless way. Since the portals would be visible both from the outside and from the inside through other portals, both sides of portal needed to appear free of adhesives or other attaching methods.

My initial design goal was to have a calculable timing mechanism; I had been told that the timing mechanism was the harder part of the hopper/timer combo, and decided to focus on a very good system from the start. This led me, almost immediately, to pendulums. Because they are periodic and fairly contained, I felt certain that they would work effectively right off the bat.\n`\n}\n/>;\n\nexport const t2 = <Text text=\n{\n`\nA long series of prototypes eventually led me to realize first that counting each swing was difficult, and second that the weight distribution was critical to making it swing in an effective way. I ended up opting for a pickaxe-like shape that held plenty of mass far away from the center of rotation, producing a very consistent swing stabilized by the 1/4\" Medium Density Fiberboard. Slots in the pendulum would hold a counter that would bounce back and forth between each side until it reached the bottom where it could make contact with a trigger.\n`}\n/>;\n\nexport const t3 = <Text text=\n{\n`Design challenges arose once the pendulum had been worked out; specifically, I needed a jumping mechanism that would effectively propel the hopper without breaking it. I initially planned to have the pendulum dislodge some sort of retaining strap or clamp, triggering some sort of launch. To achieve the launch, a system of tubing held in tension with a long rod was restrained by fishing line.\nAfter trying and failing to find a way to dislodge the fishing line reliably, a basic rocket-igniter circuit was set up to melt the line and release the rod. This had the effect of less of a hop and more of a lift-into-the-air-then-flip, but it was still covered under the definition of a hop. Best of all, it never failed a test. Reliability was one of the critical characteristics I had sought, so I was excited so have succeeded to have achieved it.\n`}\n/>;\n","import \"./Hopper.scss\";\nimport { ImageCard, Layout } from \"../../components\";\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport { final, finalExt, pendulums } from \"../../resources/projects/hopper\";\nimport { t1, t2, t3 } from \"./Text/hopperText.js\";\n\nexport default class Hopper extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    document.title = \"Hopper | Nathanael Mathieu\";\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Layout>\n        <div className=\"Hopper\">\n          <div className=\"image_text\">\n            <ImageCard alt=\"Eight pendulum prototypes on a cream colored table\"\n              size=\"4x6\" image={pendulums}\n              textEnabled text=\"Eight failed prototypes\"/>\n            {t1}\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"image_text\">\n            <ImageCard alt=\"The final hopper in compressed form, pendulum in motion\"\n              size=\"4x6\" image={final}\n              textEnabled text=\"The final hopper in compressed form, pendulum in motion\"/>\n            {t2}\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"image_text\">\n            <ImageCard alt=\"The final hopper in extended form, with the rod pointing up towards the camera\"\n              size=\"4x6\" image={finalExt}\n              textEnabled text=\"The final hopper in extended form\"/>\n            {t3}\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </Layout>\n    );\n  }\n}\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Text } from \"../../../components\";\n\nexport const t1 = <Text text=\n{\n`In what amounted to my most challenging group project by far, my group of three set out to build a marble run.

As with other coding projects, I would share my source code here but the creators of the project would prefer solutions to not be shared publicly.\nThe adjacent maze represents a portion of the search project. We were instructed to write search algorithms of various types: Depth First, Breadth First, Uniform Cost, and A*. This included exploring heuristics and a fair amount of problem solving. All three algorithms other than A* were ones that I had covered during previous classes, specifically Algorithms and Data Structures, so this project was fairly trivial. I spent much of my time considering different heuristics for A* to use. A heuristic is used to estimate the value of a state or action, and by comparing different values, the best action or future state can be chosen.

The impressive cohesion of the group made the project, building tools to help manage group work, quite ironic.\n  `\n}\n/>;\n","import \"./Tempist.scss\";\nimport { ImageCard, Layout } from \"../../components\";\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport { gantt, login } from \"../../resources/projects/tempist/\";\nimport { t1, t2 } from \"./Text/tempistText.js\";\n\nexport default class Tempest extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    document.title = \"Tempist | Nathanael Mathieu\";\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Layout>\n        <div className=\"Tempist\">\n          <div className=\"image_text\">\n            <ImageCard alt=\"The login page for Tempist\"\n              size=\"4x6\" image={login} classname=\"alt-text-color\"\n              textEnabled text=\"The login page for Tempist\"/>\n            {t1}\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"image_text\">\n            <ImageCard alt=\"The Gantt Chart view of tasks on the page\"\n              size=\"4x6\" image={gantt} classname=\"alt-text-color\"\n              textEnabled text=\"The Gantt Chart view\"/>\n            {t2}\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </Layout>\n    );\n  }\n}\n","import \"./index.scss\";\nimport * as serviceWorker from \"./serviceWorker\";\nimport { About, Contact, MainPage, NotFound, Projects } from \"./pages\";\nimport { Basinski, Cube, Hopper, Marble, Pacman, Tag, Tempist, Template }\n  from \"./pages/projects/\";\nimport { Route, HashRouter as Router, Switch } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\n\n\nconst routing =\n  <Router>\n    <Switch>\n      <Route exact path=\"/\" component={MainPage} />\n      <Route exact path=\"/basinski\" component={Basinski} />\n      <Route exact path=\"/cube\" component={Cube} />\n      <Route exact path=\"/hopper\" component={Hopper} />\n      <Route exact path=\"/marble\" component={Marble} />\n      <Route exact path=\"/pacman\" component={Pacman} />\n      <Route exact path=\"/tag\" component={Tag} />\n      <Route exact path=\"/tempist\" component={Tempist} />\n      <Route exact path=\"/template\" component={Template} />\n      <Route component={NotFound} />\n    </Switch>\n  </Router>;\n\nReactDOM.render(\nrouting,\ndocument.getElementById(\"root\")\n);\n\n/*\n * If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change\n * unregister() to register() below.
