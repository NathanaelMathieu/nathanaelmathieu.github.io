That desire has shaped much of my life. Whether it is working on coding, cooking, baking, brewing, or building, I have devoted endless hours to craft.\r\n\r\n  I started out at Wesleyan in 2016. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to study and what my career should look like. Initially a prospective Physics major, I quickly realized that my talents and interests did not fully align with that path. Purely by chance, my pre-major advisor could not see me for a meeting during Add/Drop of my Sophomore Fall and I met with Prof. Francis Starr, now the IDEAS Director, and learned about the program.

Designed as an installation piece, Basinski analyzes our relationship with memory, time, and emotion. A simple time lapse of a sunset plays on a screen with a webcam as the song dlp 1.1 plays in the background. dlp 1.1 comes from William Basinski' The Disintegration Loops, a series of short magnetic tape loops played as the magnetic material that represents their sound falls off. As the viewer observes the sunset and the hour long song plays, they begin to notice that their movements change the image.\r\n`\r\n}\r\n/>;\r\n\r\nexport const t2 = <Text text=\r\n{\r\n`As the song loops, the sunset begins to show them watching it. The webcam video continues to blend into the sunset until they are deeply connected. The tape continues to degrade. The sunset loses its color as the webcam becomes more apparent in the bright areas of the video. Near the end of the hour, almost none of the sunset remains. The sun is there, but the rest is just a tint on the screen. The song fades to darkness, and the video fades to black.\r\nThis piece was ambitious for numerous reasons. I committed to it during a very difficult time in my life. Both of my remaining grandparents entered hospice and passed away within a week of each other, provoking a lot of painful thoughts and emotions. I decided to channel that into the piece, writing a program that would meld the now into the past.\r\n`}\r\n/>;\r\n\r\nexport const t3 = <Text text=\r\n{\r\n`The Disintegration Loops have always reminded me of how fleeting our time is, and how our memory is even more fleeting. The sunset is meant to represent a beautiful memory that is fading with every passing day. As we remember it, or observe the video, we affect it, inserting ourselves into that place. We experience it for what it is now; a memory, and not for what it was. These changes stack until the memory is all but gone.\r\nI wasn't sure how I would implement this program, but committed to using Processing and interacted with the libraries directly using Java. My most critical accomplishments in terms of code were two functions that considered whether the video was being observed.\r\n`}\r\n/>;\r\n\r\nexport const t4 = <Text text=\r\n{\r\n`\r\nChanges in the RGB levels of the room and noise threshold on the mic would trigger the function that, with some randomness, faded in the webcam footage.

The code is, similarly, not accessible at present.

Several steps were taken to transform the poster into a 3D object. The outside and inside feature the same grid that made up the foreground of the poster, and the hexagonal entrances, or portals, are a based on the lighting fixtures installed in the poster's grid. After mapping the object into a third dimension, the portals allow the viewer to look into the interior space of the cube as well as out to the other side.\r\n`\r\n}\r\n/>;\r\n\r\nexport const t2 = <Text text=\r\n{\r\n`The main theme of this work is perspective. Meant as a reference to the cube’s origins as a Lighting Design competition, the interior space of the cube is lit by ambient light from the room the viewer is in. By viewing the space through a portal, the lighting of the space necessarily changes, affecting what the viewer sees. When the viewer looks through the space back into the room, there is a telescoping effect that focuses their attention on the small area in view. This change in perspective can be surprising as the colors that rim the portals change the way we see that limited field of view.\r\n`}\r\n/>;\r\n\r\nexport const t3 = <Text text=\r\n{\r\n`This project involved taking a poster and turning it into some sort of paper-based work. The poster I had chosen featured a grid with concentric circles of different colors rimmed with a glowing light effect. The initial plan was to make a cube with these circular \"portals\", as I came to call them, but upon construction of the first prototype it was clear that circles would not work.\r\nI was fixed on the portals being 3D but not stacked paper, and in order to achieve that I had to be clever about how I folded and glued the portals together. I was unable to find a cohesive way of holding them together, so I pivoted to hexagons. The flat sides were much easier to work with, as folding along the crease made a perfect area to glue to adjacent sections.\r\n`}\r\n/>;\r\n\r\nexport const t4 = <Text text=\r\n{\r\n`The change from circular to hexagonal portals was the only prototyping step done physically. In order to test my Adobe Illustrator abilities and save paper and ink, I focused on prototyping entirely digitally. This was as challenging as you would imagine, but after printing and cutting two sides of the cube with circular portals I realized that a different shape would have to be used. Hexagons were chosen for their visual fit on the triangular grid. After printing and laser cutting the components out, assembly took several hours.`\r\n}\r\n/>;\r\n\r\nexport const t5 = <Text text=\r\n{\r\n`While the greatest obstacle that I overcame in this project was the redesign of the portals, there were multiple other components that I had to work through. Many of these were in done in the conceptual digital phase, including working out the sizing of the tabs that connect each section of the portals together and ensuring that they would connect in a seamless way. Since the portals would be visible both from the outside and from the inside through other portals, both sides of portal needed to appear free of adhesives or other attaching methods. This led to very carefully sized tabs that did not overlap so that all necessary adhesive would be directly between each piece of paper. `}\r\n/>;\r\n\r\nexport const t6 = <Text text=\r\n{\r\n`\r\nMy biggest takeaway from this project was the vast amount of resources that can be saved by adequately planning the entirety of the project before beginning.

My initial design goal was to have a calculable timing mechanism; I had been told that the timing mechanism was the harder part of the hopper/timer combo, and decided to focus on a very good system from the start. This led me, almost immediately, to pendulums. Because they are periodic and fairly contained, I felt certain that they would work effectively right off the bat.\r\n`\r\n}\r\n/>;\r\n\r\nexport const t2 = <Text text=\r\n{\r\n`\r\nA long series of prototypes eventually led me to realize first that counting each swing was difficult, and second that the weight distribution was critical to making it swing in an effective way. I ended up opting for a pickaxe-like shape that held plenty of mass far away from the center of rotation, producing a very consistent swing stabilized by the 1/4\" Medium Density Fiberboard.

This had the effect of less of a hop and more of a lift-into-the-air-then-flip, but it was still covered under the definition of a hop. Best of all, it never failed a test.

Once again, I had found that complex solutions were not as successful as simple ones, even if both came up short.`\r\n}\r\n/>;\r\n","import \"./Pacman.scss\";\r\nimport { ImageCard, Layout } from \"../../components\";\r\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport { multi, reinforcement, search, tracking }\r\n from \"../../resources/projects/pacman\";\r\nimport { t1, t2, t3, t4 } from \"./Text/pacmanText.js\";\r\n\r\nexport default class Cube extends Component {\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    document.title = \"Pacman | Nathanael Mathieu\";\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <Layout>\r\n        <div className=\"Pacman\">\r\n          <div className=\"image_text\">\r\n            <ImageCard alt=\"Pacman on a maze, going towards a food pellet\"\r\n              image={search}\r\n              textEnabled text=\"Pacman used DFS to find the path to the food pellet, and is now following that path\"/>\r\n            {t1}\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div className=\"image_text\">\r\n            <ImageCard alt=\"Pacman is eating all the pellets in this ghost-free maze\"\r\n              image={multi}\r\n              textEnabled text=\"The score is the pellets eaten minus time elapsed with a bonus for eating all the pellets\"/>\r\n            {t2}\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div className=\"image_text\">\r\n            <ImageCard alt=\"Pacman is trying to stay away from two ghosts, and shaded tiles represent negative reward states\"\r\n               image={reinforcement}\r\n              textEnabled text=\"The shaded tiles are reward values for those states.

The game was based around collecting little cubes and hoarding them in base zones designated for each of the two teams.

The mount point design I settled on featured a plus-shape with a center hole cut out.

While I felt confident in using it to create these 2D parts and 3D assemblies, I doubted my ability to make more complex things. I would often find that my design worked virtually, but that it did not fit well on the robot. The solution, which I was aware of, would be to create a virtual robot to test against. Brief attempts to do so were not successful, so this more wasteful but still effective process of physical prototyping was used instead. That process would only grow more refined throughout the rest of my IDEAS career.\r\n`}\r\n/>;\r\n","import \"./Tag.scss\";\r\nimport { ImageCard, Layout } from \"../../components\";\r\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport { cageIso, cardboard, side }\r\n  from \"../../resources/projects/tag/\";\r\nimport { t1, t2, t3 } from \"./Text/tagText.js\";\r\n\r\nexport default class Tag extends Component {\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    document.title = \"Robot Tag | Nathanael Mathieu\";\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <Layout>\r\n        <div className=\"Tag\">\r\n          <div className=\"image_text\">\r\n            <ImageCard alt=\"The final side of the cage, with mount points and cutouts for wires\"\r\n              size=\"4x6\" image={side}\r\n              textEnabled text=\"One of the final laser cuts of the cage sides\"/>\r\n            {t1}\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div className=\"image_text\">\r\n            <ImageCard alt=\"An isometric sketch of the Cage\"\r\n              size=\"4x6\" image={cageIso}\r\n              textEnabled text=\"An isometric sketch of the Cage\"/>\r\n            {t2}\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div className=\"image_text\">\r\n            <ImageCard alt=\"A cardboard and hot glue prototype of the cage\"\r\n              size=\"4x6\" image={cardboard}\r\n              textEnabled text=\"Made with hot glue and cardboard, this initial cage prototype was actually fairly close to the final product\"/>\r\n            {t3}\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </Layout>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Text } from \"../../../components\";\r\n\r\nexport const t1 = <Text text=\r\n{\r\n  `When I approached Prof. Moller about making my portfolio for the upcoming spring deadlines I had mixed feelings about his suggestion that I make a web-based portfolio. I knew that it was going to be a lot of work, but that wasn't the issue. My biggest hesitation was with the what work would actually be. I had been working on Front End theory and then design for much of 2019, and came out of the theory portion excited and considering a career as a Front End developer. Then I started to work at a company doing, mostly, front end. It was not very enjoyable. I found myself far less excited about it than any other coding project I had done before.\r\n`\r\n}\r\n/>;\r\n\r\nexport const t2 = <Text text=\r\n{\r\n  `So, after the meeting with Moller, I decided I would give it a go, hoping that it would solidify my feelings about it.  My conclusion was that I loved design and hated front end. Envisioning something and making it a reality is exciting. CSS and HTML drive me insane. This was an unfortunate thing to realize as I committed to this major project, but gave me plenty of clarity.\r\n  I started this whole project by deciding on my language and tools; I had worked with React.JS and SCSS the previous summer, so I went with them. I decided to build all my components from scratch to show my front end skills off, a decision that caused many headaches later on. After sketching some Project Page designs, I decided on the 3 column grid that this page uses, and decided to build myself a component to hold each image.\r\n`}\r\n/>;\r\n\r\nexport const t3 = <Text text=\r\n{\r\n` This component, ImageCard, soaked up many hours. I have little patience for CSS problems, and it bugged me to repeatedly have to solve the same problems over and over again. I am pretty proud of ImageCard, though, as it evolved from a container for static-ratio images to a dynamic card with clickability and hover text. Overall, it's highly customizable, and I'm pretty proud of that. When I encountered a feature I wanted it to have, I put it into my backlog and tried to add it soon. Still, everything would have been much easier if I had used a component library for this and all the other elements.\r\n\r\n`}\r\n/>;\r\n\r\nexport const t4 = <Text preformatted=\r\n{\r\n<p>\r\n  I did plenty of layout wireframes, eventually making a bunch of moveable pieces of paper that I could rearrange freely.
