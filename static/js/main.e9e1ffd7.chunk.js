In the first iteration of IDEAS 175, my group of four decided to build a customizable robot battling platform that would allow people to develop their own mechanisms for competing in a game generally known as Tag.

While I felt confident in using it to create these 2D parts and 3D assemblies, I doubted my ability to make more complex things. I would often find that my design worked virtually, but that it did not fit well on the robot. The solution, which I was aware of, would be to create a virtual robot to test against. Brief attempts to do so were not successful, so this more wasteful but still effective process of physical prototyping was used instead.

I had been working on Front End theory and then design for much of 2019, and came out of the theory portion excited and considering a career as a Front End developer.
