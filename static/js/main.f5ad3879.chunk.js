We were instructed to write search algorithms of various types: Depth First, Breadth First, Uniform Cost, and A*. This included exploring heuristics and a fair amount of problem solving. All three algorithms other than A* were ones that I had covered during previous classes, specifically Algorithms and Data Structures, so this project was fairly trivial. I spent much of my time considering different heuristics for A* to use.
